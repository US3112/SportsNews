         Kylian Mbappe has confirmed that he will remain at Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) next season, dispelling rumors about his potential departure. The 24-year-old forward, who signed a two-year deal with an option until 2025, had been linked with a move to Real Madrid. However, he made a U-turn and expressed his commitment to PSG, stating that he is calm, happy, and focused on being the best player. Mbappe has had a remarkable season, scoring 40 goals in 42 appearances, including 28 in Ligue 1. He was voted as the player of the year at the recent UNFP awards and expressed his pleasure at achieving such success. While there are uncertainties surrounding the long-term futures of Lionel Messi and Neymar at PSG, Mbappe's statement confirms his intention to stay at the club.
