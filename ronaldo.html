      <h2>Ronaldo's Contract with Al Nassr Worth Over 200m Euros ($214.5m)</h2>
      <p>
        Cristiano Ronaldo has joined Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr on a two-and-a-half-year contract.
        The Riyadh-based team announced the signing, hailing it as "history in the making."
        Ronaldo left Manchester United the previous month after expressing his feelings of betrayal by the club and lack of respect for the manager.
        Al Nassr shared a picture of Ronaldo holding up the team's jersey on social media.
        The deal is expected to inspire the club, the league, and future generations.
        Ronaldo expressed his excitement to join his new teammates and help the club achieve success.
        The financial details of the contract were not disclosed, but media estimates suggest it is worth over 200 million euros ($214.5 million).
        Ronaldo brings an impressive collection of honors, including numerous league titles and Champions League victories, from his previous clubs such as Real Madrid and Juventus.
        The move to Saudi Arabia is seen as a significant step in his career, and he plans to retire at the age of 40.
        Al Nassr hopes Ronaldo's presence will contribute to their pursuit of domestic and continental success.
