      <h2>Manchester City have become the first English Premier League club since Manchester United to win a treble of all three major trophies in one season</h2>
      <p>
         Manchester City has achieved a historic feat by winning their first-ever Champions League title and completing a treble by defeating Inter Milan 1-0. Midfielder Rodri scored the decisive goal in the 68th minute, securing victory for Pep Guardiola's team at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. This triumph adds to City's earlier victories in the Premier League, where they outperformed Arsenal, and their recent win over Manchester United in the FA Cup final. The treble win marks City as the first English Premier League club since Manchester United to achieve this remarkable accomplishment. The presence of owner Sheikh Mansour, who rarely attends matches, added to the significance of the moment. Under Mansour's ownership, Manchester City has become a dominant force in English football, winning seven Premier League titles in the last 12 years and five of the last six.
